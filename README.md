# Mobile_Sonnets
This is a mobile app I created for the University of Washington Continuing Education class in HTML 5 course 300.

It was based on code patterns in the mobile tutorial on the Dojo Toolkit website: https://dojotoolkit.org/

The sonnets presented in this app are from The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, by William Shakespeare.

From Project Gutenberg:
"This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org"
